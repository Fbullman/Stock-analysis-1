### Results
Since the Stock Chosen initially had a negative return for the year of 2018, we compared the stock performance for all companies between the years 2017 and 2018, adding a interactive button to run the analysis quick and facilitate the visualization of analysis results.

### Summary
The advantages of using Refactoring code to run analysis in the whole data is to bring fast results, responding few possible questions with a simple click of a button, optmizing the analysis and reducing time in presenting data.

1. Sub AllStocksAnalysisRefactored()
   - Dim startTime As Single
    - Dim endTime  As Single

Unsing a timer to show the exact time the analysis is ran and delivered.

2. - startTime = Timer
